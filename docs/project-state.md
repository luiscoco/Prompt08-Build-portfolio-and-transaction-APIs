## Latest milestone report — 08

**What works:** Authenticated GET/POST /api/portfolios, GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/portfolios/:id, paginated GET and idempotent POST /api/portfolios/:id/transactions. Thin Node.js Route Handlers call an owner-scoped application service using shared Zod contracts. Portfolio edits rename only; DELETE archives without erasing history, and archives remain readable but reject new financial entries/renames. Trades are immutable; financial corrections use explicitly posted compensating entries under the documented restrictions. Plain decimal strings fit storage precision; positive quantity/price, nonnegative fees, USD stock symbol/exchange identity, calendar-valid UTC millisecond dates, no future trades, amount overflow and sell fees above proceeds are checked. BigInt fixed-point arithmetic calculates quantities and amounts exactly; amounts round half up to ten places. Full chronological ledger validation rejects oversells at any prefix, including later sales affected by backdating. PostgreSQL sequence orders equal-time trades deterministically. Owner-filtered row locks serialize trades, rename and archive in one database transaction with bounded lock/pool/transaction timeouts and three conflict attempts. Per-portfolio unique idempotency keys plus canonical request fingerprints prevent duplicate posting, reject changed-payload reuse and support exact replays after archive. No Redis dependency for financial correctness.

**Changed files:** Added packages/db/src/portfolio-service.ts and prisma/migrations/20261001080000_portfolio_api/migration.sql; added packages/domain/src/ledger.ts and ledger.test.ts; added apps/api/lib/portfolio-http.ts, portfolio.integration.test.ts, portfolio collection and transaction Route Handlers. Modified portfolio resource Route Handler, authorization.ts and http.ts; contracts/src/index.ts; db schema, repositories, exports, manifest and database verifier; domain exports; package-lock.json. Added ADR 0004 and lesson 08; updated decision index, versions and this state. No instruction files or milestone plan changed; no dependencies upgraded, no application data reset.

**Check results:** npm ci installed 347 packages; npm shim's trust delegation initially failed, so actual commands used node with the installed npm-cli.js at C:/Users/luisc/AppData/Local/Author Software/nvm/installs/v24.21.0/node_modules/npm/bin/npm-cli.js. npm run typecheck passed all workspaces after allowing Prisma access to its installed engine cache (initial sandboxed generation failed EPERM). npm run build passed web/API/worker, and final API rebuild passed after retry error-mapping correction. Prisma validate passed. migrate:deploy applied both migrations to fresh local portfolio_m08_verify and the additive migration to existing disposable portfolio_m07_auth_verify. npm run test with both PORTFOLIO_TEST_DATABASE_URL and AUTH_TEST_DATABASE_URL passed 48 tests total, including all 25 API tests with eight new real PostgreSQL acceptance tests and eight existing authentication checks; no integration tests skipped in that final run. Earlier credential-free suite passed 32 local tests with optional integration suites skipped. Browser boundary check passed. New acceptance covers invalid input/zero writes, names and immutable fields, anonymous/origin rejection, every cross-owner resource method, concurrent duplicate/reused keys, archived replay/history, equal-time order, different exchange inventory, pagination, backdating, conflicting sales, archive race, amount overflow/rounding/tiny fractions and bounded lock exhaustion/recovery. First acceptance run used nonexistent AAPL instead of synthetic ACME and was corrected. Lock-timeout test exposed Prisma adapter nested originalCode metadata; retry classification was corrected and rerun successfully. Existing Vite directive warnings and three Next instrumentation Node/Edge warnings remain. Historical standalone milestone 06 database verifier was adapted to archive/errors/bigint serialization but not rerun; the new milestone 08 tests exercise these behaviors directly.

**How to demonstrate:** See [lesson 08](lessons/08-portfolio-and-transaction-apis.md) for exact setup, browser-console API calls and test commands. With local DATABASE_URL configured, run npm run build:types, npm run migrate:deploy --workspace @portfolio-pilot/db, then npm run dev; sign in as Alice at http://localhost:5173. Create a portfolio, post ACME/XNAS BUY with Idempotency-Key, replay it, attempt quantity-11 SELL against quantity-10 inventory (409), paginate, rename and archive; history survives. Sign in as Bob and request Alice's ID (404). Financial screens still show fixtures until milestone 10. For tests set PORTFOLIO_TEST_DATABASE_URL to the dedicated loopback portfolio_m08_verify database and run npm run test --workspace @portfolio-pilot/api; optionally set AUTH_TEST_DATABASE_URL to portfolio_m07_auth_verify to rerun authentication acceptance too.

**Remaining limitations:** Offset pagination is not a snapshot across requests; refresh from zero after backdated inserts. Validation scans the full ledger and is linear in history. Compensating entries do not erase historical accounting effects; corrections that cannot maintain long-only intermediate inventory require a future audited workflow. No restoration, transaction editing/deletion, valuation or UI integration is in this slice. No live browser/network smoke was run for the new routes; acceptance directly invokes actual Route Handlers with real signed sessions and PostgreSQL. Next optional manual verification: npm run dev, follow lesson 08 console calls after Alice sign-in, then repeat as Bob. Real Entra remains unverified as documented in milestone 07. Privileged SQL and explicit local seed operations are outside supported application mutation paths. No paid resources, public deployment, commits or pushes; this folder is not a Git repository. The disposable local milestone 08 database remains available and only this run's created test portfolios were cleaned up.

## Previous milestone report — 07

**What works:** Better Auth 1.7.7 Prisma-backed eight-hour absolute sessions with signed HttpOnly/SameSite=Lax cookies (Secure in production), no cookie caching or password auth, local demo plugin restricted to explicit dev/test loopback opt-in and two seeded aliases, logout/replay invalidation, expiry, GET /api/me, protected frontend gate and query-cache clearing. Production configuration requires HTTPS, persistent secret, PostgreSQL and tenant-specific Entra settings; invalid production configuration terminates startup with exit 1. Microsoft OIDC provider disables account auto-linking and encrypts provider tokens. Reusable requireAuthorization/requirePortfolio mint the existing opaque repository contexts from verified current sessions. Read-only portfolio resource route uses owner filtering and identical safe 404s for foreign/missing IDs. Every application non-health route is authorized, including the temporary AI route, which also requires local development and demo opt-in. Auth options/sign-in/callback are intentionally public handshake endpoints; other raw library endpoints are blocked. Strict exact-origin mutations supplement enabled library CSRF/state/nonce checks. No CORS headers or public deployments.

**Changed files:** Added apps/api/lib/auth.ts, authorization.ts, auth.test.ts, auth.integration.test.ts, auth catch-all Route Handler, /api/me and owner-scoped /api/portfolios/[id]; modified demo AI POST, lib/http.ts, instrumentation.ts, API manifest/env example and package-lock.json; added apps/web/src/auth.tsx and modified App.tsx; extended server configuration. Added ADR 0003, lesson 07 and missing root README; updated ADR index, versions and this state. Existing owner-scoped repositories and migration reused unchanged; no instruction files intentionally edited and no dependencies upgraded.

**Check results:** Installed pinned Better Auth and workspace dependencies using the installed npm CLI (nvm npm shim rejected delegated execution). Existing migration deployed successfully to a new local portfolio_m07_auth_verify database in the existing port 5546 PostgreSQL 17.6 container. All API tests with AUTH_TEST_DATABASE_URL passed: 17, including eight PostgreSQL acceptance checks and three auth unit checks. Full npm run test passed: 30 tests, eight optional database tests explicitly skipped without the URL, empty workspaces reported no tests. npm run build and npm run typecheck passed; final API rebuild passed after production-exit hardening. Browser dependency boundary check passed. Live Next.js through Vite proxy verified anonymous 401, demo login, /me, cross-owner 404, authenticated mock AI, forged origin 403, logout and old-cookie replay 401. OIDC fixture checks verified HTTPS Secure cookie config, no demo plugin, single-tenant authorization URL, state, PKCE/openid, foreign callback URL 403 and forged callback error. Production Next startup with DEMO_AUTH_ENABLED=true refused configuration and exited 1. Earlier compile/typecheck failures were corrected (portable inferred return types and installed provider/cookie types); OIDC test initially exposed Better Auth's test-mode origin-check default and explicit security flags now ensure protections run. Vite directive warnings and three Next instrumentation Node/Edge analysis warnings remain. Browser tool reported no available browser, so visual/interaction checks did not run.

**How to demonstrate:** Follow [lesson 07](lessons/07-authentication-and-authorization.md). With local PostgreSQL, copy/merge API .env example, migrate and explicitly seed in development, set DEMO_AUTH_ENABLED=true and AUTH_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173, then npm run dev. Open exactly http://localhost:5173, choose Alice, inspect /api/me and her demo-growth resource, confirm demo-bob-core is 404, sign out, choose Bob and repeat. Financial screens remain shared static fixtures; API ownership uses actual database rows. For acceptance reruns use AUTH_TEST_DATABASE_URL pointing to the dedicated portfolio_m07_auth_verify database and npm run test --workspace @portfolio-pilot/api. The isolated verification database remains available; no application/previous milestone data was reset.

**Remaining limitations:** Real Entra consent/code exchange/ID-token/JWKS/nonce verification, user persistence/repeat sign-in, optional managed-user email claim and actual HTTPS gateway cookie behavior require tenant credentials and a registered redirect URI. Next command after providing documented production config and same-origin HTTPS gateway: npm run build, npm run start --workspace @portfolio-pilot/api, then click Microsoft sign-in, check /api/me and logout 401. App logout does not terminate Microsoft SSO. Browser visual checks require an available browser: npm run dev and execute the Alice/logout/Bob/reload flow in lesson 07. Demo requires local PostgreSQL but no OIDC/AI/market credentials; ephemeral development secret invalidates cookies across restart. Periodic session cleanup/distributed rate limiting and broader hardening remain later work. Full CRUD/transaction services are milestone 08; connecting financial screens to private API data remains milestone 10. No Git repository exists here; nothing committed, pushed, provisioned or deployed.

## Previous milestone report — 06

**What works:** PostgreSQL schema/migration for User, Session, Account, Verification, Portfolio, exchange-aware Security, PortfolioTransaction, WatchlistEntry, QuoteSnapshot, NewsArticle and NewsArticleSecurity. UTC timestamps, numeric price/quantity/fees/amount columns, SQL CHECK invariants, indexes, unique keys and deliberate cascade/restrict actions. Transactions are the source of truth; no persisted positions. Session-derived opaque contexts protect owner-scoped portfolio/watchlist mutations and ledger/quote/news reads. Financial DTOs use fixed-point decimal strings, including very small fractions. Explicit local-only seed creates two users, three portfolios, five buys/sells, distinct same-symbol listings and synthetic historical quotes/news, with an injected fixture clock and atomic/concurrent idempotency. No credentials or sessions are seeded.

**Changed files:** This empty milestone folder was initialized from milestone 05 without its .git, dependencies or cache; the earlier folder was left unchanged. Added/modified `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`, `prisma.config.ts`, `prisma/migrations/20261001000000_initial/migration.sql`, migration lock, package scripts, `src/index.ts`, `src/repositories.ts`, `src/seed.ts`, `src/seed-cli.ts`, boundary tests and database integration verifier; `packages/contracts/src/index.ts` and ledger contract tests; database diagram, ADR 0002/index, lesson 06, versions notes, README and state. No existing instruction files were edited and no dependency versions changed.

**Check results:** `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund` installed 328 packages after network access was permitted. Prisma 7.10.0 validate/generate passed. Generated SQL plus reviewed CHECK constraints deployed to PostgreSQL 17.6 in an isolated local container on port 5546. The first migration attempt failed before table creation because the schema engine had not generated base SQL; recovered via non-destructive `migrate resolve --rolled-back` and deploy. A second, entirely new database `portfolio_m06_verify_final` received the complete migration directly and passed the final integration verifier: exact row/timestamp equality after repeated/concurrent seeds, synthetic flags, cross-owner reads/mutations, missing/fabricated/expired/revoked contexts, fixed-point tiny decimals, SQL constraints, uniques and cascades. `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test` (27 tests) and `node scripts/check-browser-boundary.mjs` passed. Existing Vite directive warnings and two Next.js Node/Edge analysis warnings remain. Optional Prisma engine `migrate diff --from-config-datasource --to-schema ... --exit-code` failed P1001 despite the live adapter checks passing; container pg_isready confirmed ready. No database reset ran. The compiled seed CLI also ran twice successfully with explicit local opt-in and printed the synthetic historical-price label both times. The disposable verification container remains available on localhost:5546 for inspection; it does not use the normal Compose volumes.

**How to demonstrate:** Follow [lesson 06](lessons/06-database-and-seed.md) for explicit migration/seed commands and the isolated fresh-database verifier. The normal demo seed requires a loopback DATABASE_URL, NODE_ENV=development/test and ALLOW_DEMO_SEED=true; run it twice. The verifier requires an empty disposable `portfolio_m06_verify` (also accepts `portfolio_m06_verify_final`) database and NODE_ENV=test. It intentionally changes fixture data to verify deletes and must not run against the application database. See [diagram](database-diagram.md) and [ADR](decisions/0002-database-ledger-and-auth.md).

**Remaining limitations:** Actual auth library integration, cookie/session issuance, demo login and Entra OIDC remain milestone 07. Repository contexts must be freshly resolved per request and never cached across logout. Trade APIs, pagination cursors, aggregate long-only/concurrency checks and weighted-average valuation follow in milestones 08/09. The frontend still uses its visibly labeled fixtures. Optional engine-based schema-drift verification is blocked by P1001; with local engine connectivity fixed, rerun `prisma migrate diff --config packages/db/prisma.config.ts --from-config-datasource --to-schema packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma --exit-code` using the port 5546 verification URL. SQL CHECK constraints are not represented by Prisma's schema diff and are verified by integration tests. This workspace has no Git repository; nothing committed, pushed or deployed.
## Previous milestone report — 05

**What works:** Compose defines pinned PostgreSQL 17.6 and Redis 7.4.5 with health checks, localhost-only ports, and named volumes. npm scripts start, stop, and inspect the stack; volume reset requires an explicit flag. The API has separate liveness and dependency readiness routes. Prisma 7 uses the PostgreSQL adapter; Redis uses node-redis with bounded reconnection. URLs are validated, connections are reused, and a shutdown hook closes them. No Azure resources were provisioned.

**Changed files:** `compose.yaml`, `scripts/infra.mjs`, root and workspace package manifests and lockfile, `packages/db` client and schema, server config and tests, API health routes and tests, instrumentation, local environment example, `README.md`, `docs/lessons/05-local-infrastructure.md`, and this state file.

**Check results:** `docker compose -f compose.yaml config --quiet` passed. `npm run build` and `npm run typecheck` passed with existing Vite warnings and two new Next.js Edge analysis warnings for the Node-only shutdown hook. `npm run test` passed its pre-existing 19 tests; the new API readiness tests then passed separately (6 API tests total). Unconfirmed volume reset exited 2 before calling Docker. `npm run infra:status` failed because Docker engine pipe access was denied. The live container/API smoke test was not run.

**How to demonstrate:** Follow the milestone 05 section of `README.md`. With an accessible Docker Linux engine, run `npm run infra:start`, `npm run infra:status`, copy `apps/api/.env.example` to `apps/api/.env.local`, run `npm run build` and `npm run dev`, then request `/api/health/live` and `/api/health/ready`. Run `docker compose stop redis`; readiness should return 503 while liveness stays 200. Restore with `npm run infra:start`. `npm run infra:stop` preserves volumes; `npm run infra:reset -- --confirm-delete-volumes` deletes them.

**Remaining limitations:** Docker pipe access was denied on this host, so PostgreSQL and Redis container health, API access to both, and the readiness transition on dependency stop are unverified. The exact next smoke test commands are above. The Prisma schema has no application models or migrations until milestone 06. This workspace is not a Git repository, so no commit was made.
## Previous milestone report — 04

**What works:** The Assistant screen sends a bounded question to local-development-only `POST /api/demo/ask` and displays a completed answer or an error. `AgentService` has deterministic mock and Claude Agent SDK implementations. Mock answers are labeled. Claude mode requires an explicit server API key and model ID, uses the installed SDK 0.3.276 `query` API, disables built-in tools with `tools: []`, limits a run to one turn, an estimated USD 0.02 SDK budget, and 20 seconds. SDK settings and runtime data are directed to a configured absolute workspace outside the source repository; session persistence is disabled. Missing credentials fail with a clear configuration error and never fall back to mock. The endpoint is unavailable outside local development and is bound to loopback in the API dev script. It is temporary and must be removed when authenticated run endpoints replace it.

**Changed files:** `packages/agent/src/index.ts` and `test/agent.test.ts`; `packages/contracts/src/index.ts`; `packages/config/src/server.ts` and `test/config.test.ts`; `apps/api/app/api/demo/ask/route.ts` and `route.test.ts`, `apps/api/lib/http.ts`, `apps/api/package.json`, `apps/api/.env.example`; `apps/web/src/app.tsx`, `src/styles.css`, `e2e/shell.spec.ts`; `package-lock.json`; `docs/lessons/04-first-agent-slice.md`; this state file. No instruction files were changed.

**Check results:** `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund` installed 302 packages. `npm run build` passed after two TypeScript fixes, including Next.js production compilation and route typecheck. `npm run typecheck` and `npm run check:browser-boundary` passed. `npm run test` passed 18 tests across contracts, config, agent, web, and API. With `npm run dev` running, `npm run test:browser --workspace=@portfolio-pilot/web` passed all three Chrome tests, including a visible mock answer from a browser question. Vite emitted the existing non-fatal third-party `use client` warnings. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `AGENT_MODEL_ID`, and `AGENT_WORKSPACE_DIR` were absent in this shell; the live SDK smoke test was not run.

**How to demonstrate:** With Node/npm active, run `npm ci`, `npm run build`, then `npm run dev`. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173/assistant`, enter a question, and select Send message. The result is labeled “Mock answer.” Run `npm run test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run check:browser-boundary`, and, while dev servers run, `npm run test:browser --workspace=@portfolio-pilot/web`. On this host use the direct Node 24.21.0/npm CLI invocation described in the milestone 03 report if the npm shim is inactive. For an optional live check, set `AGENT_MODE=claude`, `AGENT_MODEL_ID` to a model available to your Anthropic API account, `AGENT_WORKSPACE_DIR` to an absolute path outside this repository, and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the API server environment, restart dev, then ask one short question. The SDK budget remains USD 0.02; no account login is used.

**Remaining limitations:** Live Claude behavior is unverified because no application API key or model configuration was present; configure those server variables and run the one-question browser check above. The dev endpoint has no authenticated user and must not be deployed as a user API. It returns one completed answer, with no persistence, streaming, portfolio context, news grounding, citations, or durable cancellation. The source directory is not a Git repository, so no commit was made. The pre-existing Next.js-generated `apps/api/AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` remain pending approval to remove.

**Documentation follow-up (2026-10-01):** Created the root `README.md` for students. It explains milestone 04's purpose, the actual implementation sequence, observed checks, mock and optional live run commands, and remaining limits. The README was absent in this workspace before the follow-up. Only documentation changed; application checks were not rerun.

## Previous milestone report — 03

**What works:** The React app has Dashboard, Portfolios, News, Assistant, Watchlist, and Settings routes. A sidebar becomes a mobile drawer; the portfolio selector updates summary and holdings. Dashboard cards, holdings table, news, and a clearly disabled assistant preview use deterministic fixture DTOs. Every page visibly labels demo data and a fixed UTC snapshot. The shell has a skip link, named navigation, table semantics, labeled controls, visible focus, responsive layouts, and reusable empty/loading/error/stale state components. The API client validates JSON with a supplied schema and distinguishes HTTP envelope errors, invalid responses, timeouts, cancellation, and network failures. TanStack Query manages the API health query.

**Changed files:** `apps/web/package.json`, `src/main.tsx`, new `src/app.tsx`, `src/styles.css`, `src/data/demo.ts`, `src/lib/api-client.ts`, `src/lib/api-client.test.ts`, `src/lib/format.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`, and `e2e/shell.spec.ts`; `packages/contracts/src/index.ts`; `package-lock.json`; `docs/versions.md`; `docs/lessons/03-ui-shell.md`; this state file. No instruction files were changed.

**Check results:** `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint` (the current project script runs TypeScript), `npm run test`, and `npm run check:browser-boundary` passed using the installed Node 24.21.0 executable and npm CLI with its directory prepended to `PATH`. Ten unit tests passed (two contracts, four config, four web API client). With `npm run dev` running, `npm run test:browser --workspace=@portfolio-pilot/web` passed two Chrome tests covering routes, portfolio selection, keyboard Tab/Enter, the mobile drawer and Escape, and no page-wide horizontal overflow at 390 px. Desktop 1440 px and mobile 390 px screenshots were captured and visually inspected. The first browser run failed because a text locator matched three demo labels; the locator was made specific and the final run passed. The first root unit run picked up the Playwright spec; the web Vitest command now scopes to `src`, and the final root run passed. An experiment with Playwright-managed server startup passed the tests but hung at teardown on Windows, so the final test configuration uses the manual `npm run dev` workflow and exits cleanly. Vite emitted non-fatal third-party `use client` directive warnings during the successful build.

**How to demonstrate:** With Node/npm active, run `npm install`, `npm run dev`, then open `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`. Visit all six routes, switch from Growth to Income Portfolio, resize below 850 px to use the drawer, and use Tab/Enter and Escape. Run `npm run test:browser --workspace=@portfolio-pilot/web` to repeat the Chrome smoke test; run `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, and `npm run check:browser-boundary` for project checks. On this host, invoke npm through `C:\Users\luisc\AppData\Local\Author Software\nvm\installs\v24.21.0\node.exe` and its adjacent `node_modules\npm\bin\npm-cli.js`, with the Node install directory first in `PATH`.

**Remaining limitations:** Portfolio, watchlist, news, and market figures are fixtures, not persisted or live provider data. The Assistant input is disabled until milestone 04. Only the health endpoint uses the API client so far. Browser smoke coverage is limited to installed Chrome at 1440 px and 390 px, not a full accessibility audit or other browser engines. This workspace has no `.git` directory, so no commit was made. Next.js-generated `apps/api/AGENTS.md` and `apps/api/CLAUDE.md` remain from milestone 02 because their removal was rejected by automatic approval review.

**Documentation follow-up (2026-09-30):** Added `README.md` as a beginner-friendly guide to milestone 03, its verified results, run commands, and current limits. This follow-up changed documentation only; no application checks were rerun. A static check confirmed the requested sections and fenced command examples are present.

## Previous milestone report — 02

**What works:** npm workspaces cover the three applications and seven shared packages with explicit exports and ordered shared builds. React/Vite serves on 5173; the Node.js Next Route Handler serves `GET /api/health/live` on 3001 through the Vite `/api` proxy. The route returns a UUID request ID in both the JSON body and `x-request-id` header; invalid server configuration uses the shared error envelope. Browser and server config have separate Zod entry points, with empty example placeholders and mock defaults. The worker reports its role and exits cleanly on its shutdown message. The browser package graph is limited to web, contracts, and config.

**Changed files:** Root `package.json`, `.gitignore`, `tsconfig.base.json`, `package-lock.json`, `scripts/`; new `apps/web`, `apps/api`, `apps/worker`, and `packages/contracts`, `packages/domain`, `packages/db`, `packages/providers`, `packages/agent`, `packages/config`, `packages/observability`; `docs/versions.md`, `docs/lessons/02-monorepo-contracts.md`, and this state file. Next.js generated `apps/api/AGENTS.md` and `apps/api/CLAUDE.md` during the dev smoke check; they remain in the workspace because automatic approval review rejected their removal. `agentRules: false` now prevents regeneration.

**Check results:** Direct Node invocation of the installed npm 11.19.0 CLI ran `npm install --no-audit --no-fund` successfully (295 packages; lockfile created), then `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run test` successfully. The test run has six passing focused contract/config assertions; other workspaces currently have no test files. `npm run check:browser-boundary` passed, and source/built asset scans found no agent SDK, Prisma, Node-only import, or server secret marker in web code. `npm ls` confirmed the approved core versions. `npm run dev` started Vite and Next.js; HTTP checks returned 200 for `/` and `/api/health/live` through port 5173, with matching request IDs. The worker printed its role and a graceful IPC shutdown message, then exited 0. Normal `npm` invocation is blocked by the local NVM trust shim; direct Node + npm CLI invocation works. A separate single-workspace npm build attempt failed intermittently through that shim, while the final root build and typecheck passed.

**How to demonstrate:** In a shell with Node/npm active, run `npm install`, `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test`, `npm run check:browser-boundary`, then `npm run dev`. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` and `http://127.0.0.1:5173/api/health/live`. For the worker, run `npm run start --workspace=@portfolio-pilot/worker` after build and stop with Ctrl+C. On this host, substitute `& 'C:\Users\luisc\AppData\Local\Author Software\nvm\installs\v24.21.0\node.exe' 'C:\Users\luisc\AppData\Local\Author Software\nvm\installs\v24.21.0\node_modules\npm\bin\npm-cli.js'` for `npm`.

**Remaining limitations:** No browser automation or visual inspection was run; the HTTP and production build checks verify delivery but not browser rendering. The database and agent packages expose boundaries only; their persistence and SDK behavior belong to later milestones. Prisma install scripts were not allowlisted by npm, and no Prisma schema/generation is needed until milestone 06. This directory is still not a Git repository, so no commit was made. Automatic approval review rejected removing Next.js-generated `apps/api/AGENTS.md` and `apps/api/CLAUDE.md`, citing the contract's protection of instruction files; removal requires explicit user approval.

## Previous milestone report — 01

**What works:** A stable, exact dependency version set and Node 24.21.0 LTS/npm 11.19.0 baseline are documented in `docs/versions.md`, with official compatibility references. Root metadata pins the runtime and package manager. `.gitignore` excludes credentials, SDK transcripts, generated output, and local database files.

**Changed files:** `.nvmrc`, `.npmrc`, `package.json`, `.gitignore`, `docs/versions.md`, `docs/lessons/01-toolchain.md`, and this state file. No application code or packages were installed.

**Check results:** `git --version` passed (2.52.0.windows.1); `docker --version` passed (28.5.2); `docker compose version` passed (2.40.3); `nvm list` found 24.21.0 installed. `node --version` and `npm --version` failed because no active Node version is configured. `docker info --format '{{.ServerVersion}}'` failed with access denied to the Docker config/engine pipe. `git status --short` failed because this directory is not a Git repository. Direct PowerShell request to `https://registry.npmjs.org/react/latest` failed to connect; registry package pages and official docs were reviewed through web access. `Get-Content package.json -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json` passed, confirming valid JSON and the selected engine/package manager fields. Static checks found the intended `.gitignore` exclusions and both new docs; `package-lock.json` does not exist. A local install, lockfile resolution, build, and tests were not run.

**How to demonstrate:** Review `docs/versions.md`, `.nvmrc`, `.npmrc`, `package.json`, and `.gitignore`. In Windows PowerShell, run `nvm use 24.21.0; node --version; npm --version`. In Linux/WSL2 with `nvm-sh`, run `nvm install 24.21.0 && nvm use 24.21.0 && node --version && npm --version`. After milestone 02 creates workspace manifests and network access works, run `npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts`, `npm install`, and the `npm ls ...` command in `docs/versions.md`.

**Remaining limitations:** This shell cannot currently activate Node/npm, access the npm registry directly, use the Docker engine, or inspect Git history. SDK installed types and full resolved peer graph must be checked when dependencies are installed. There is no lockfile because no dependency manifests or install exist yet. Docker and credentials are unnecessary for milestone 01.

## Previous milestone report — 00

**What works:** The project contract, assistant pointer file, 36-milestone plan, state tracker, and
ADR index exist. No application code has been generated.

**Changed files (all new):**
- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- `docs/project-plan.md`, `docs/project-state.md`
- `docs/decisions/README.md`, `docs/decisions/0001-architecture-baseline.md`
- `docs/lessons/00-project-contract.md`
- `README.md` (added after the milestone at the user's request; a student-facing explanation of
  Prompt 00. Milestone 36 replaces it with the full application README.)

**Check results:** Documentation-only milestone; no build, lint, or test tooling exists yet.
Verified that the workspace was empty beforehand, so no existing instruction files were overwritten.

**How to demonstrate:** Open `AGENTS.md`, then `docs/project-plan.md`. Start a fresh assistant
session and confirm it reads `CLAUDE.md` ? `AGENTS.md` ? `docs/project-state.md`.

**Remaining limitations:**
- ~~The folder is not a git repository.~~ Resolved: the user initialized the repository and added
  the GitHub remote; the Milestone 00 docs and README were committed and pushed to `main` on request.
- No versions are pinned yet; that is milestone 01.

## Open decisions and blockers

- Better Auth database/session model is chosen in ADR 0002; its maintained version and integration are verified in 07. Live quote/news provider and gateway controller are decided in their
  milestones (07, 12, 35) and recorded as ADRs.
